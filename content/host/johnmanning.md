Dr. Manning is an innovative, usability-focused informatician developer with skills in design and video editing. He is double-boarded in Emergency Medicine and Clinical Informatics; practices clinically at Atrium Health; and educates medical students / residents at the bedside (Assistant Professor). He was also one of the founding board members of AMIA Clinical Informatics Fellows (ACIF) and served as their first secretary during his fellowship.

Dr. Manning specializes in teaching Flutter development and its specific applications within healthcare. Many of these applications are housed on his YouTube channel (Flutter Juun), his GitHub (FireJuun), or his startupâ€™s collaborative blog (MayJuun). He helped create the FHIR-FLI collaborative, which focuses on the intersection between Flutter and the global standard for healthcare interoperability, FHIR. Finally, he is the lead author of the KOI Pond, which is an open publication that defines informatics practice based on setting (internal, external, policy) and focus area (knowledge, operations, innovation).
