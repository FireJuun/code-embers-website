In this Code Embers health informatics podcast, we discuss the Microsoft acquisition of Nuance. We cover some classification standards such as Health Level 7®'s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources® (FHIR®) and the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), with a larger focus on FHIR®. We also explain "The Curly Braces Problem" and how that relates to informatics.
